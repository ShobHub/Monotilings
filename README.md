# Monotilings

This repository contains code related to enumeration of perfect matchings on monotilings using the Fisher–Kasteleyn–Temperley (FKT) algorithm.

## Contents
- **MaxMatch.py**  
  Generates Spectre tilings using SVG data files obtained from: [Spectre App by C.S. Kaplan](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~csk/spectre/app.html).  
  It also generates various maximum matchings on the resulting tiling.

- **FKT.py**  
  Implements the FKT algorithm to compute the total number of perfect matchings for a given tiling of a specified size.
